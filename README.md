# Maslow_pi_pendant

This repository was originally intended to be an add-on for the Webcontrol Maslow control software.  It is a python code base that interacts with the webcontrol web socket interface and it was originally envisioned to run on a pizeroW credit card-sized micro computer with the lite raspian distribution.  The hardware setup in the author's build is a repurposed NES controller with a 3D printed cover that holds the pizeroW while using the original nintendo buttons with and added tri-color LED and a 1" OLED display.  A small Li battery pack is required for power to keep the device truely wireless, but it could be plugged in if desired.  The screen can provide status information such as elapsed cut time, sled position as well as control movement of the sled and the z axis for setup positioning of home and starting/stopping/pausing/resuming cut operations.

Future iterations could possibly be made to work with Makerverse by communicating over the socket interface.
