To set up buttons:

mkdir ~/.local/share/systemd/user/

cp ~/WebControl/*.service ~/.local/share/systemd/user/

that is all for the button and LED service.

To set up the bluetooth wii remote as a pendant input, copy these files also

cp ~/WebControl/MaslowPendant.service ~/.Control/systemd

cp MaslowPendant.py ~/.WebControl/systemd

This service requires the installation of the cwiid library compiled for python 3
